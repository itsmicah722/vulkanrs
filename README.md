# Vulkan-RS

As of now I am 17 years old learning programming. This is a Vulkan based engine written in Rust. I am a beginner in
both the Rust Language and Vulkan, but this will be a persistent project. I didn't implement OpenGL because after some
research I just decided Vulkan would be a better fit in the long-term or maximum performance. I realize that OpenGL
would be more than enough for my tiny little engine, but Vulkan is the modern replacement, and has great
documentation and learning resources just like OpenGL, so why not?

I am currently following a guide to learn, though I plan to eventually use this repository as a long-term
development project for my own engine, using what I learn overtime. The more I learn Vulkan the more I realize this
more than likely won't become a fully-featured "game engine" but I certainly (eventually) want to the least make a 3D
renderer capable of ray-tracing, post-processing effects, animation, GUI, shadow maps, etc.

I used the [Vulkanalia Tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/introduction.html) to learn the basics of
the Rust FFI to Vulkan and the Vulkan API itself. All credit goes to the
[Repository](https://github.com/KyleMayes/vulkanalia) and
[Contributors](https://github.com/KyleMayes/vulkanalia/graphs/contributors). I greatly appreciate their learning
resources, and would highly recommend to other newcomers.
